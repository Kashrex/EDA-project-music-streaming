 This Project Demonstrates E2E Exploratory Data Analysis using Raw Dataset, leveraging PySpark and python libraries.

# This Project has been developed in Google Colaboratory. Similar IDE's like Jupyter can also be leveraged.
Project Description - EDA on Music Streaming Website Dataset:

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a music streaming website dataset.
- The objective of the project is to cleanse the raw data and visualize the top artists in each genre of music using different charts.
- The dataset contains information about music tracks, artists, genres, and user interactions.
- Conduct data cleansing and preprocessing to handle missing value and data inconsistencies.
- Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of genres, artist popularity, and user interactions.
- Perform data aggregation and grouping to identify the top artists in each genre based on various metrics such as play counts or user ratings.
- Utilize different chart types for visualization, including bar charts, pie charts, line charts, scatter plots, or box plots, to present the findings.
- Create separate charts for each genre to showcase the top artists and their corresponding metrics.
- Ensure the visualizations are clear, visually appealing, and provide meaningful insights.
- Use appropriate labeling, titles, and axis descriptions to enhance the understanding of the charts.
- Summarize the key findings and observations from the visualizations, highlighting the most popular artists in each genre.
- Provide recommendations or further analysis possibilities based on the EDA results.


Note: The project assumes prior data cleaning and preprocessing steps have been completed, and the dataset is ready for exploratory analysis and visualization.
